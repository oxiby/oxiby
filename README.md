# Oxiby

**Oxiby** is a statically typed programming language inspired primarily by [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
Oxiby programs compile into readable [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) source code, which can then be executed by the Ruby interpreter.

The language was motivated by the question:

**What if a developer wants the high-level features of Rust, but does not need its low-level features, and maximal performance is not a requirement?**

## Project status

Oxiby is in very early development.
It is not suitable for authoring production software.
Its goals and designs are frequently changing.
It is experimental and should be considered an exercise in design with the primary goal of learning.

## Documentation

The [Oxiby website](https://www.oxiby.com/) contains documentation including a comprehensive, tutorial-style language guide,  with standard library and language reference documentation planned.

## Code of conduct

In lieu of a more formal code of conduct (for now), participation in Oxiby development through source code contributions, issue reports, feedback, and other forms of communication requires that the participant be kind to other participants and avoid discrimination or harrassment of any kind.

## Provenance

Oxiby is written, maintained, and used by and for humans.
Source code and documentation contributed should be developed by a human and not a large language model or other stochastic "intelligence."
